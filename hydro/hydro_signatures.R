### Purpose

# This document contains R functions to compute streamflow indices (hydrological signatures).
# These functions have been used and are still used to produce the CAMELS datasets. The wrapper
# compute_hydro_signatures_camels enables the computation of the signatures selected for the
# original CAMELS paper (Addor et al., 2017, HESS).

# For some signatures, several formulations have been implemented and the resulting estimates are
# returned as a data.frame. Alternative formulations can be added. The objective is to assess the
# sensitvity of the results to the formulation of the hydrological signatures.

### Load functions
